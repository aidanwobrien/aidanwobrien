- 👋 Hi, I’m @aidanwobrien
- 👀 I coordinate conservation GIS and Land Securement across the Oak Ridges Moraine and Greenbelt in Ontario, Canada. Currently I am the GIS and Database Analyst for Forests Ontario. I am interested in the impacts of technology on nature, politics and society. I also like music and writing 🎹 🖊️
- 🌱 I work primarily in QGIS, Python (pandas, pyqgis, geopandas), R and Jupyter Notebook. I've been getting my toes wet with some JavaScript. Sometimes I make audio-responsive visualizers with pygame and p5js 💥
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web-scraping programs, interactive web-maps and database creation for environmental data in Ontario.
- 📫 You can email me at aidan.w.obrien@gmail.com or throw me a message on Twitter @ecoaidan.
